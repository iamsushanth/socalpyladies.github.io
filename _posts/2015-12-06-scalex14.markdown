SCaLE stands for the Southern California Linux Expo, which is a conference on free and open-source software. Open-source software has its source code available for you to see, change, and use for any purpose. 

Python is free and open-source, as such PyLadies has a booth at SCaLE in order to promote our goal of an active and positive Python community by providing outreach and education to women.
