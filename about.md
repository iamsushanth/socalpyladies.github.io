We are a Southern California outreach group with a focus on education and bringing more women into the active and positive Python community.

PyLadies is a community of Python developers. We love to write code, some of us hack on side projects while others work full-time engineering Python based products. We all want a positive, active Python community and we do that by volunteering our time to PyLadies events and encouraging other women to engage in projects.
