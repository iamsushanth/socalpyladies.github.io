We are a Southern California outreach group with a focus on education and bringing more women into the active and positive Python community.

PyLadies is a community of Python developers. We love to write code. Some of us hack on side projects, while others work full-time engineering Python-based products for their companies. 

We all want a positive, active Python community where women are encouraged to participate, and one which feels friendly and approachable to all. We achieve that by volunteering our time to PyLadies events and encouraging other women to engage in projects.
